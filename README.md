# Doubo Public Channel Directory

A daily-updated M3U index of TV channels that broadcasters make **freely and publicly available** worldwide. Browse it in your language at <https://doubo.tv/en/playlists/>

> This repository stores and relays **no video**. It only lists links that pass the [inclusion policy](POLICY.md).

## Usage

Paste any of these links into [Doubo](https://doubo.tv) or any player that supports M3U playlists:

## What gets listed

1. Only streams served from the channel's own website domain, or from a broadcast-grade CDN / official free streaming platform on the [allowlist](policy/allowed-hosts.txt).
2. No paid channels, no adult content, no closed channels.
3. Channels on the iptv-org blocklist or our [takedown list](policy/takedown.csv) are excluded.
4. Streams that do not respond are left out of each daily build.

Full details: [POLICY.md](POLICY.md).

## Sources

Channel data and links come from the community projects [iptv-org/database](https://github.com/iptv-org/database) and [iptv-org/iptv](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv), filtered by the stricter policy above.

## Takedown

Rights holders can ask for a channel or link to be removed with a [takedown request](https://github.com/maweis1981/iptv-playlists/issues/new?template=takedown.yml). Requests are handled within 72 hours and take effect in the next daily build.

## Repository layout

- `main`: the generator (`scripts/build.py`), the policy (`policy/`) and the workflow.
- `dist`: the playlists generated every day by GitHub Actions. Do not edit it by hand.
